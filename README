latency-meter is a simple program to measure latency of another program
or of a tcp/ip network connection such as ssh.

latency-meter launches a command specified on command line, it connects
to the command by two pipes and repeatedly sends a one line message to
command's standard input. It expects a one line answer from it's standard 
output. The time between sending and receiving lines is meassured and 
displayed.




Examples:

Measure latency of cat program (together with two linux pipes):

  ./latency-meter "cat"

Measure latency of ssh connection to a remote computer

  ./latency-meter "ssh remotehost cat"





Install/Build:

  gcc -o latency-meter latency-meter.c




Usage:

  latency-meter [<message>] <command>
